<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>On November 3, 2020, Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in the Presidential Election. Biden won the popular vote by a margin of about 7 million votes. He received 51.4% of the popular vote nationwide. More importantly, Biden won the Electoral College vote 306-232. Coincidentally, this was the same final Electoral College tally by which Trump defeated Clinton in 2016 (although the official tally was 304-227 due to 7 faithless electors). Soon after the election was completed and while votes were still being tallied, Trump, the Republican Party, and other Trump supporters began to call in question the votes in six key states: Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Michigan. Biden ultimately won all six states, some by close margins. Trump had won four of these in 2016.</p>
<p>Throughout the rest of November and on into December, Trump and his supporters filed over 50 lawsuits seeking to overturn the Biden victory in some or all of those six states. Conservative media amplified Trump’s claims. Trump supporters staged protests, even protesting armed at the house of the Secretary of State of Michigan. The lawsuits and protests made many different kinds of arguments that the election was stolen from Trump in these six states.</p>
<p>One line of argument used in many of the lawsuits is that the results in these states were statistically so unlikely as to signify fraud. In other words, these arguments were not evidence of fraud but rather inferences of fraud from the election data. These arguments were advanced by a number of different “experts” who analyzed publically available data to come to their conclusions. In these notes, I describe and evaluate each argument, making clear the statistical ideas used in each.</p>
<p>It will come as no surprise to anyone who knows me that I don’t find these arguments compelling. Some are more sophisticated than others but none of them are very strong. It is significant that none of the “experts” used in the various lawsuits were, in fact, experts. No statisticians contributed to these efforts. Most of these arguments came from individuals who probably had some statistical training and worked in technical fields (e.g., engineering) but really didn’t understand what they were doing. Statistics is hard.</p>
