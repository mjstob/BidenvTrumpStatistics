Biden won the popular vote by a margin of about 7 million votes. He received 51.4% of the popular vote nationwide. More importantly, Biden won the Electoral College vote 306-232. Coincidentally, this was the same final Electoral College tally by which Trump defeated Clinton in 2016 (although the official tally was 304-227 due to 7 faithless electors). Soon after the election was completed and while votes were still being tallied, Trump, the Republican Party, and other Trump supporters began to call in question the votes in six key states: Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Michigan. Biden ultimately won all six states, some by close margins. Trump had won four of these in 2016. Throughout the rest of November and on into December, Trump and his supporters filed over 50 lawsuits seeking to overturn the Biden victory in some or all of those six states. Conservative media amplified Trump’s claims. Trump supporters staged protests, even protesting armed at the house of the Secretary of State of Michigan. The lawsuits and protests made many different kinds of arguments that the election was stolen from Trump in these six states. One line of argument used in many of the lawsuits is that the results in these states were statistically so unlikely as to signify fraud. In other words, these arguments were not evidence of fraud but rather inferences of fraud from the election data. These arguments were advanced by a number of different “experts” who analyzed publically available data to come to their conclusions. In these notes, I describe and evaluate each argument, making clear the statistical ideas used in each. It will come as no surprise to anyone who knows me that I don’t find these arguments compelling. Some are more sophisticated than others but none of them are very strong. It is significant that none of the “experts” used in the various lawsuits were, in fact, experts. No statisticians contributed to these efforts. Most of these arguments came from individuals who probably had some statistical training and worked in technical fields (e.g., engineering) but really didn’t understand what they were doing. Statistics is hard. "],
["one-in-a-quadrillion.html", "1 One in a quadrillion 1.1 Clinton and Biden in Georgia", " 1 One in a quadrillion Donald Cicchetti, an independent contractor and PhD economist from Berkeley supplied an analysis that was included in several lawsuits, including the Supreme Court action brought by the state of Texas against Pennsylvania. His conclusions were featured in many public statements from Trump supporters including tweets from the Trump press secretary. Cicchetti completed three different analyses: comparing Biden’s share of the two party vote in Georgia to that of Clinton (in 2016), comparing early vote totals in battleground states to later vote totals, comparing the rejection of ballots in Georgia in 2016 to that of 2020, and an analysis of absentee ballots in Wayne County, MI. 1.1 Clinton and Biden in Georgia Biden did better in Georgia than Clinton did in 2016. Candidate Votes Pct Clinton 1877963 0.459 Trump 2089104 0.510 Candidate Votes Pct Biden 2474507 0.495 Trump 2461837 0.493 Cicchetti argues that it is statistically impossible that Biden’s percentage of the vote should be 3.6% greater thatn that of Clinton. The argument he gives is known as a hypothesis test. Statistics 101 students know it as the two-proportion Z-test and indeed the section in Cicchetti’s brief is called “Z-Scores for Georgia”. In a hypothesis test, one first constructs a “null hypothesis” and then uses the data to see whether the “null hypothesis” is plausible. In this case, the framework for the hypothesis test asssumes that we have samples from two different populations and are observing the proportion of each sample that has a given characteristic. In this case, our samples are clearly the actual voters of 2016 and 2020 respectively and the proportions are the percentages of votes voting for the Democratic candidate (45.9% and 49.5% respectively). The null hypothesis assumes that each sample is from a population and that the relavant proportion of each population is identical. In this case, the null hypothesis is that the proportion of all possible voters in 2016 who would vote demcratic is identical to the proportion of all possible voters in 2020 who would vote democratic. One then computes a number, called the \\(p\\)-value (less than 1 in a quadrillion in this example). The \\(p\\)-value is interpreted this way: if indeed the two populations have identical proportions of people who would vote democratic, the probability that Biden’s actual percentages would be so different is less than 1 in a quadrillion. Cicchetti finds this compelling evidence of fraud. It is easy on its face to see why, though Cicchetti computation might be right, it is entirely unsurprising. We have no reason to suppose that the populations of 2016 possible voters and 2020 possible voters are identical. First, they are not the same voters. Some voters dropped off the rolls and many more were added (over a million). Second, there is no reason to suppose that Clinton’s popularity in the 2016 population is the same as the Biden popularity in the 2020 population. Biden was a more popular candidate than Clinton in almost every state. The conclusion of the hypothesis test is pedestrian - the popularity of Biden and Clinton are different. Though any Statistics 101 student knows that the Cicchetti aa quadrillion (and is very small in the other three as well). rgument is flawed, there is a common sense way of seeing Cichetti’s mistake. Cicchetti’s hypothesis test can be applied to any state. And it turns out, in 48 of the 51 contests, the \\(p\\)-value is less than 1 in a trillion, Another way of saying this is that Biden’s popularity in no state was exactly the same as Clinton’s. We would have been amazed to find out otherwise! Essentially, Cicchetti should make exactly the same argument for any state and argue that the results in any state, even those in which Trump did better than 2016, are not to be trusted. In fact, Cicchetti’s argument can be used to show that no election can be believed. Based on the 2012 election results, the 2016 election results cannot be believed. Trump could not have done as well as he did. In the end, we run elections because we know that things might turn out differently than four years ago. And we shouldn’t be surprised when they do. "]
